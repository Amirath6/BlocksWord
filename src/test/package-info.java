/**
 * <b>
 *     Package that contains the tests of all packages of the project
 * </b>
 *
 * <p>
 *     In this package, there is a test class for each package of the
 *     project. Each test class contains a main method that runs the
 *     tests of the package. Each test class also contains a test method
 *     for each principal method of the class it tests.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     We have the following packages:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li> representation: contains the classes that represent the problem to solve</li>
 *     <li> planning: contains the classes that perform the planning  problem</li>
 *     <li> csp: contains the classes that perform constraint satisfaction</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 *     Each test class depends on the success of the tests of the
 *     representation package.
 * </p>
