/**
 * <b>
 * Package that contains all the classes that represent the problem to solve
 * </b>
 *
 * <p>
 * In this package, there is a class for each element that permits to represent a problem.<br>
 * For solving the problem, we need to represent the problem through variables,
 * constraints. <br>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * So with this package, we can manipulate the variables and their domains to
 * help to represent and solve the problem. <br>
 * We can also manipulate the constraints that is represented by a formalism of attributes-value.
 * So a constraint is a logical relationship between different variables and each variable having
 * a value in its domain. So a constraint on a set of variables restricts the possible values of
 * these variables can take simultaneously. <br>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * We have the following classes:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li> Variable: represents a variable of the problem to solve</li>
 *     <li> Constraint: represents a constraint of the problem to solve</li>
 *     <li> BinaryConstraint: represents a binary constraint of the problem to solve</li>
 *     <li> DifferentConstraint: represents a different constraint of the problem to solve</li>
 *     <li> ImplicationConstraint: represents an implication constraint of the problem to solve</li>
 *     <li>UnaryConstraint: represents a unary constraint of the problem to solve</li>
 * </ul>
